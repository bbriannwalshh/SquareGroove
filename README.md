# SquareGroove

[SquareGroove site](https://squaregroove.herokuapp.com/#/)

`SquareGroove` is a programmable audio synthesizer, created by 3 engineers over the span of 5 days. Our goal was to provide an intuitive way for those who have little to no music background to begin creating their own songs. We wanted to give everyone the opportunity to love the process of making music, and hopefully provide a foundation for a future in music learning and creation.

## Technology used:
* React/Redux for frontend rendering
* Express.js for backend MVC framework
* MongoDB and AWS S3 for database

## Features
The grid aesthetic allows for users to program notes by clicking individual squares, pausing and playing the program, switching between different samples in the navigation bar, as well as change the BPM (beats per minute) of the song.
Users can create and save their own grids, as well as listen to other grids in the community.


## Intuitive Interface
The program is immediately understandable. Start by clicking different notes in the grid pattern. The top grid is to program musical notes, with the bottom grid of three rows programming drums.
